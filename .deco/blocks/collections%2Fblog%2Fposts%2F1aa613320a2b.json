    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt\">Our journey starts a long time ago, in 2004, with a company called MoIP (Money over IP). One of our founders, Leo, was visiting Silicon Valley and he came across the Paypal business model, which was disrupting US traditional payment methods at that time. When he came back to Brazil, he immediately went over to Igor with an idea: “we have to create a similar business in Brazil”. Long story short, MoIP was a huge success and, in 2016, they sold the business to Wirecard for US$41MM. MoIP started with the aspiration to be the Brazilian Paypal, but, when it started to scale, its purpose became helping SME company owners to thrive in their businesses. MoIP supported thousands of business owners to receive online payments and walk their first steps into the digital universe, watching them grow inside MoIP’s platform. As they were helping other small entrepreneurs to succeed, Leo and Igor quickly understood the economic impact of small business and it led them to find their life’s purpose, which was to develop solutions that could help those entrepreneurs.<br><br>In this MoIP journey, the founders learned a lot in terms of scaling a company, hiring people, setting up a good business strategy and raising money, but more importantly, it showed them what they love to do and what they don’t want to do. The founders became part of the Wirecard executive team until the end of 2018 when Wirecard changed its MoIP focus to enterprises instead of SMBs, and Leo and Igor knew that it wasn’t what they wanted to do, and decided to leave Wirecard to create more SMBs solution.. This was the first call for the Cora adventure.<br><br>When they left Wirecard they had this weird sensation that there was still a lot to do in the Brazilian financial system but payments were no more an issue for the SMBs. The industry in need of disruption was banking. They started Cora to provide a superior offering to Brazilian consumers. When Cora was launched, and still to this day, incumbent banks in Latin America offered similar checking account products, credit limits, interest rates, and annual fees to all customers based on homogenous underwriting methodologies and customer management strategies. Customers in Brazil were paying some of the highest interest rates and fees in the world, and were often ignored and taken for granted. There are 6.4 million businesses in Brazil, and 99% of them are small enterprises, accounting for 52% of formal jobs in the private sector (16.1 million) – according to Sebrae¹ (a Brazilian organization supporting SMBs). <br><br>Millions of entrepreneurs do not receive a lot of attention from the large incumbent banks and they frequently have difficulty getting loans and finding financial services tailored to their needs. The 5 biggest traditional banks in Brazil hold approximately 70% of the total credit operations - according to the Brazilian Central Bank (2019) - and their biggest profits come from expensive credit lines offered to SME businesses, resulting in a 42% net margin on their top 3 credit products. Even though those rates are no good, SME business owners have to choose them only because they still don’t have enough other options to choose from.<br><br></span></p>",
