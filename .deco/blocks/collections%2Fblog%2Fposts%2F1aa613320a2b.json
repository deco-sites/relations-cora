    "content": "<p>Our journey starts a long time ago, in 2004, with a company called MoIP (Money over IP). One of our founders, Leo, was visiting Silicon Valley and he came across the Paypal business model, which was disrupting US traditional payment methods at that time. When he came back to Brazil, he immediately went over to Igor with an idea: “we have to create a similar business in Brazil”. Long story short, MoIP was a huge success and, in 2016, they sold the business to Wirecard for US$41MM. MoIP started with the aspiration to be the Brazilian Paypal, but, when it started to scale, its purpose became helping SME company owners to thrive in their businesses. MoIP supported thousands of business owners to receive online payments and walk their first steps into the digital universe, watching them grow inside MoIP’s platform. As they were helping other small entrepreneurs to succeed, Leo and Igor quickly understood the economic impact of small business and it led them to find their life’s purpose, which was to develop solutions that could help those entrepreneurs.In this MoIP journey, the founders learned a lot in terms of scaling a company, hiring people, setting up a good business strategy and raising money, but more importantly, it showed them what they love to do and what they don’t want to do. The founders became part of the Wirecard executive team until the end of 2018 when Wirecard changed its MoIP focus to enterprises instead of SMBs, and Leo and Igor knew that it wasn’t what they wanted to do, and decided to leave Wirecard to create more SMBs solution.. This was the first call for the Cora adventure.When they left Wirecard they had this weird sensation that there was still a lot to do in the Brazilian financial system but payments were no more an issue for the SMBs. The industry in need of disruption was banking. They started Cora to provide a superior offering to Brazilian consumers. When Cora was launched, and still to this day, incumbent banks in Latin America offered similar checking account products, credit limits, interest rates, and annual fees to all customers based on homogenous underwriting methodologies and customer management strategies. Customers in Brazil were paying some of the highest interest rates and fees in the world, and were often ignored and taken for granted. There are 6.4 million businesses in Brazil, and 99% of them are small enterprises, accounting for 52% of formal jobs in the private sector (16.1 million) – according to Sebrae¹ (a Brazilian organization supporting SMBs). Millions of entrepreneurs do not receive a lot of attention from the large incumbent banks and they frequently have difficulty getting loans and finding financial services tailored to their needs. The 5 biggest traditional banks in Brazil hold approximately 70% of the total credit operations - according to the Brazilian Central Bank (2019) - and their biggest profits come from expensive credit lines offered to SME businesses, resulting in a 42% net margin on their top 3 credit products. Even though those rates are no good, SME business owners have to choose them only because they still don’t have enough other options to choose from.</p><p></p><p><span>From the beginning, our objective has been to solve the difficulties of managing the finances of small and medium-sized companies, creating a completely new service and a simple product, capable of simplifying the routine of the business owners. Looking into the future, we want to be the informed decision making interface of the entrepreneurs.<br><br>We know that every business carries a story and that behind this story is someone's persistence and effort. We know this because we are a bank of entrepreneurs. Made with affection, respect and admiration for those who dedicate themselves. Who struggle in their routines to break through an increasingly difficult world on their own. We are a different bank, which knows how difficult it is to start a business. <br>Our journey starts in mid-2019 when the first idea of Cora Bank was conceived. In the beginning, it was only the founders and a small group of people who created an MVP and started testing along with family and friends. In October of 2020, with an “SCD” license issued by the Brazilian Central Bank in our hands, we launched our first product, a digital checking account, a Visa-branded debit card and with a powerful value proposition:<br><br><br></span><span style=\"color: #d4265a\">bureaucracy free: </span><span>sign up in minutes, no paperwork, digital-only<br></span><span style=\"color: #d4265a\">easy to use:</span><span> intuitive and simple experiences<br></span><span style=\"color: #d4265a\">free: </span><span>no monthly or transaction fees <br><br><br>Cora credits its ability to offer this solution to the decision to take the longer and more expensive route of building up its own technology stack from scratch and having its own licenses. With no intermediaries or third-party constraints, Cora can better control its customer experience, reduce the burden of layered bureaucracy and have lower operating costs, which it can pass on to customers.<br><br><br>Our financial solution is delivered to clients via a mobile app, with dedicated development teams for both Android and iOS. We also have the internet banking (CoraWeb) option, but our main platform is the app. Our strategy has been understanding every need of a company owner and creating a powerful solution to it. One of Cora’s pillars is to deliver an outstanding user experience in each of our products and services, so we can delight our customers and gain enough insights to deliver more client-centered solutions.<br><br>Since 2020, a lot has changed: we launched our Credit Card in November 2021, added several features (web app, multi-users account, virtual cards, recurring invoices, API payments, collection tools, integrated fiscal documents), and finally, in July 2024, Cora became a “SCFI”, (Investment, Financing and Credit Society), an institution regulated by the Brazilian Central Bank that is allowed to offer investment products, unlike “SCDs”.<br><br>Even though Cora believes it already has a differentiated value proposition compared to incumbents, its long-term vision aggregates banking and financial management software. It has already started to add additional software layers to what is perceived as traditional banking services. Because of that, its customers additionally can:<br><br><br></span><span style=\"color: #d4265a\">save time</span><span> in repeated tasks that have been automated, such as configurable billing flows and accounting software integration.<br></span><span style=\"color: #d4265a\">scale up</span><span> as they can bring collaborators, accountants and partners to manipulate the account, but still preserve the money movement control.<br></span><span style=\"color: #d4265a\">better understand and control</span><span> their business performance, with advance reporting and dynamic dashboards.<br></span></p>",
